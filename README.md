# Ruby-Week
Three projects and their associated files are included in my first week's foray into Ruby Programming.

<strong>Book Database</strong></br>
This project allows the user to add books to a database, count books by author, delete an author's book titles, and find all the books written by a given author. The programming logic is sound, but before deploying, I'd give it a more intuitive interface, so that the user knows the commands available to them (for you, they're commented in the code!).

<strong>Eliza Interface</strong></br>
This project, named for the first computer to simulate human interaction, acts as a psychiatrist--run eliza.rb and she will give general answers. If your input includes "dog", "mom" or "hurt", she will give a specific answer.
</br></br>
I began to add an additional feature, called "Yelling Mode", which returns all of Eliza's answers in uppercase, but this feature has not been finalized. The tests for this project are also incomplete.

<strong>Poetry Reader</strong></br>
This project includes several files, which analyze and compare the texts of two poems, "The Man From Snowy River" and "Clancy of the Overflow". See comments in the code for more details on the exercises completed.
